  <h2>What is Archie Markup Language?</h2>
  <p>
    ArchieML (or "AML") was created at The New York Times to make it easier to write and edit structured text on deadline that could be rendered in web pages, or more specifically, rendered in interactive graphics. 
  </p>
  <p>One of the main goals was to make it easy to tag text as data, without having type a lot of special characters. Another goal was to allow the document to contain lots of notes and draft text that would not be read into the data. And finally, because we make extensive use of Google Documents's concurrent-editing features — while working on a graphic, we can have several reporters, editors and developers all pouring information into a single document — we wanted to have a format that could survive being edited by users who may never have seen ArchieML or any other markup language at all before.
  </p>

  <h3 id="why-not">Why not YAML? Or JSON?</h3>

  <p>ArchieML differs from other popular formats like <a href="http://yaml.org/">YAML</a> and <a href="http://json.org/">JSON</a> in several areas that we've found are key to making it easy to use:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Whitespace is not significant to the document structure</strong>
        <br>
        In YAML, lines must be indented precisely and variably; the wrong number of spaces to the left of a key invalidates the document, and tabs can't be used. AML ignores all whitespace not within a value. We believe this makes it easier for non-programmers to use, and is essential for use in environments with non-monospaced fonts, like in Google Documents.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Unstructured text is ignored; there is no such thing as a parsing error</strong>
        <br>
        AML was designed so that writers could work in a freeform environment. They should be able to add inline comments to text or entire paragraphs as scratch work that do not appear in the output. JSON and YAML have strict schemas that forbid text deviating from a pattern. AML doesn't assume text follows any pattern. If it finds text that looks like data, it treats it as data. Otherwise, it moves on.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>The notation makes sense to non-programmers</strong>
        <br>
        Lists of values are noted with bullet points / asterisks, not hyphens or quoted strings that must be separated with commas. Comments are written [INLINE INSIDE BRACKETS? THIS WORK, RACHEL?]. An overriding goal was to have a intuitive format that could be passed to a non-technical user  — a reporter, an assigning editor or a copy editor — to edit, and to have the format be clear enough that they could make changes without breaking the parsing of the document. If we were using another format, we'd have to explain indentation rules in YAML, or how to match curly braces or properly escape quotation marks in JSON, and so forth.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="practice">How Does It Work in Practice?</h3>

  <p>For a very simple example, here's a screenshot of the Google Doc that powers a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/01/31/sports/football/common-ploys-of-patriots-and-seahawks.html">recent graphic about the trick plays</a> used by the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks:</p> 

  <div class="example-image"><img src="assets/example-football.png"></div>

  <p>To generate the graphic, we load the ArchieML data from the document using the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/archieml ">archieml-js npm module</a>, then pass it to an underscore template to render the final markup server-side. This lets the journalists who are focusing on the text and content concentrate on getting the copy in shape independently of the developers working on the graphic.</p>

  <p>While this is a very simple example, with only a few bits of text and data and one comment at the end that is ignored, when we're covering a breaking news story, we can have a half-dozen people all contributing to a Google Doc at the same time as we gather all the information we need for a graphic and turn it into the final copy blocks that make their way into the finished piece.</p>


  <h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>

  <p>There are several parsers that implement the ArchieML spec.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>archieml-js</strong> is a JavaScript parser for ArchieML. It can be used client-side in the browser, or using Asynchronous Module Definitions (AMD) such as RequireJS, and has test coverage. It is available over the Node Package Manager. 
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/newsdev/archieml-js">Github</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/archieml">Node Package Manager</a></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>archieml-ruby</strong> is a Ruby parser for ArchieML. It is available through the RubyGems package manager, and has test coverage.
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/newsdev/archieml-ruby">Github</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/archieml">RubyGems</a></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>rchie</strong> is an R parser for ArchieML by <a href="https://twitter.com/noamross">Noam Ross</a>, wrapping the archie-js parser.
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/noamross/rchie">Github</a></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="google-docs">Integrating with Google Documents</h3>

  <p>At The New York Times, we normally write ArchieML in Google Documents. Both parsers include quick-start examples for how to download text from Google Docs and run it through the parser. They also include some formatting steps we take, such as converting links to HTML tags.<br />
  Examples:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/newsdev/archieml-js/tree/master#using-with-google-documents">JavaScript example</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/newsdev/archieml-ruby/tree/master#using-with-google-documents">Ruby example</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="demo">Introductory Demo</h2>

  <p>Click on any ArchieML textarea to try it out yourself, and see how changes affect the output.</p>

  <h3>Keys and values</h3>

  <p>Strings can be stored as part of key/value pairs, defined whenever a line in ArchieML begins with a token followed by a colon. Keys can contain letters, numbers, hypens and underscores. The rest of the string is the value.</p>

<aml>
key: This is a value
</aml>

  <p>Whitespace surrounding keys and values is ignored. Indent as you like. Keys are case sensitive.</p>

<aml>
1: value
2:value
3   : value
 4:    value
5:	value	

a: lowercase a
A: uppercase A
</aml>

  <p>Lines that don't look like keys or other special commands are ignored:</p>

<aml>
This is a key:

  key: value

It's a nice key!
</aml>

  <h3>Nested key structure</h3>

  <p>Use dot-notation to create nested objects.</p>

<aml>
colors.red: #f00
colors.green: #0f0
colors.blue: #00f
</aml>

  <p>You can also use "object" blocks to namespace a group of keys.</p>

<aml>
{colors}
red: #f00
green: #0f0
blue: #00f

{numbers}
one: 1
ten: 10
one-hundred: 100
{}

key: value
</aml>

  <p>You can end an object with a line beginning with {}, or by beginning a new object. ArchieML is parsed one line at a time, so ending "tags" like {} are never required.</p>

  <p>Dot notation can be used in object namespaces as well:</p>

<aml>
{colors.reds}
crimson: #dc143c
darkred: #8b0000

{colors.blues}
cornflowerblue: #6495ed
darkblue: #00008b
</aml>

  <h3>Arrays of objects</h3>
  <p>Groups of keys can be placed inside an array by giving the array a name within brackets. The name of the array can be any valid key, and can use dot-notation. You can optionally end an array with an empty set of brackets, or by beginning a new array.</p>

<aml>
[scope.array]
[]
</aml>

  <p>All keys inside the array are inserted into a single object within the array. The parser remembers the first key it found, and whenever it encounters it again, a new object is started.</p>

<aml>
[arrayName]

name: Amanda
age: 26

# Contact: 434-555-1234
name: Tessa
age: 30

[]
</aml>

  <h3>Arrays of strings</h3>

  <p>You can also create "simple" or "flat" arrays of strings. If an asterisk is encountered first within an array, that array will become a simple array, and key/value pairs within it will be ignored. If a key/value pairs is encountered first, then asterisk lines will be ignored.</p>

<aml>
[days]
* Sunday
note: holiday!
* Monday
* Tuesday

Whitespace is still fine around the '*'
  *   Wednesday

* Thursday

Friday!
* Friday
* Saturday
[]
</aml>

  <h3>Multi-line values</h3>

  <p>Values automatically end when a newline is encountered. But all subsequent text is read into a buffer that can be added to that key. Anchor the end of a multi-line value by following the value with a line beginning with ":end". All whitespace within the block is preserved.</p>

  <p>Try removing the last line to see how it changes the output:</p>

<aml>
key: value
 More value

Even more value
:end
</aml>

  <h4>Works within object and simple arrays</h4>

<aml>
[arrays.complex]
key: value
more value
:end

[arrays.simple]
* value
more value
:end
</aml>

  <h4>Escape characters</h4>

  <p>You can place any text inside of a multi-line value. If one of your lines would be interpreted by the parser as a key or some other special command, you may have to escape that line by adding a backslack to the beginning of it. The backslash won't be included in the value.</p>
  <p>Try removing the backslashes from the following lines:</p>

<aml>
key: value
\:end
:end
</aml>

<aml>
key: value
\more: value
:end
</aml>

<aml>
key: value
[escaping *s is not necessary if we're not inside an array, but will still be removed]
\* value
:end
</aml>

<aml>
key: value
\:ignore
\:skip
\:endskip
:end
</aml>

  <h3>Inline comments</h3>

  <p>Anything within a complete set of single brackets on one line will be ignored.</p>

<aml>
title: Lorem ipsum [IGNORED] dolor sit amet
</aml>

  <p>Double up the brackets to preserve a single set.</p>

<aml>
title: Lorem ipsum [[PRESERVED]] dolor sit amet
</aml>

  <h3>Block comments</h3>

  <p>Wrap text between lines that begin with ":skip" and ":endskip" to ignore blocks of text.</p>

<aml>
:skip
  this: text
  will: be
  ignored
:endskip
</aml>

  <p>There is also a safety mechanism of sorts built in. When the parser encounters a line beginning with ":ignore" (even if it's within a :skip block), parsing immediately stops, and the rest of the document is ignored.</p>

<aml>
key: value
:ignore

[array]
* Blah
[]

other-key: other value
</aml>
